    EF-S - A newer variant of EF with shorter flange depth, allowing
           for manufacturing of less expensive wide-angle lenses. Not usable

Contax:
    N - ?

Generic:
    M42 - First used in Zeiss Contax S (1949) and then adopted by many
          other manufacturers due to patent-less nature.
    M39/1 - Russian metric variant of Leica's M39 mount.
    T2 - Introduced by Tamron in 1957, with adaptors for virtually all other
         mounts (due to large flange distance).  Used in astronomical
         devices and some mirror lenses.
    C - Intended for cinematographic lenses on very different viewframe sizes
        (often smaller that µFT), it can be adapted to most mirrorless systems.
        It has a very short flange distance, but due to the small radius of
        most C mount lenses, the adapter can be realised as a ring around the
        lens.  In photography, most C mount lenses must be considered fun
        lenses.
