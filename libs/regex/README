This is a subset of the TRE regular expression library:

Home page: http://www.laurikari.net/tre/index.html

This library is used on platforms without a built-in regular expression
library (e.g. windoz). On most Unices this library is not needed.

The library is licensed under same terms as Lensfun library, so there's no
problem linking them together.
