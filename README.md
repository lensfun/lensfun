WHAT IS IT
----------

The goal of the Lensfun library is to provide a open source database
of photographic lenses and their characteristics. In the past there
was a effort in this direction (see http://www.epaperpress.com/ptlens/),
but then author decided to take the commercial route and the database
froze at the last public stage. This database was used as the basement
on which Lensfun database grew, thanks to PTLens author which gave his
permission for this, while the code was totally rewritten from scratch
(and the database was converted to a totally new, XML-based format).

The Lensfun library not only provides a way to read the database
and search for specific things in it, but also provides a set of
algorithms for correcting images based on detailed knowledge of
lens properties. Right now Lensfun is designed to correct
distortion, transversal (also known as lateral) chromatic aberrations,
and vignetting.

The interface is defined both using C++ style and plain C.
The C interface is a wrapper around the C++ classes.

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
------------------

The build system is based on CMake (http://www.cmake.org/). In order to
successfully configure and build the project the following tools are more
or less required:

 - CMake
 - Doxygen in order to generate the library documentation.
 - GLib > 2.26 which is used for low-level I/O and XML parsing.
 - GLib > 2.40 to build the unit tests with the GLib test framework.
 - libpng is required to build and run the example implementation.
 - xmllint to test the database XML validity

First enter the Lensfun root folder and create a build directory.

    cd lensfun
    mkdir build

Enter the build directory and run CMake to configure your sources and create
the build files

    cd build
    cmake ../

Run make/make install as usual

    make
    make install

After that, you may want to use ldconfig to add the necessary symlinks so that
programs can find and use Lensfun.

The following CMake options can be set (defaults are upper case):

    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG|Release        select debug or release build mode
    -DINSTALL_HELPER_SCRIPTS=off|ON         install various helper scripts
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/USR/LOCAL       install prefix

    -DBUILD_STATIC=OFF|on       build static or shared lib
    -DBUILD_TESTS=OFF|on        build also the test programs
    -DBUILD_LENSTOOL=OFF|on     build Lensfun reference implementation
    -DBUILD_FOR_SSE=off|ON      build with SSE optimisation
    -DBUILD_FOR_SSE2=off|ON     build with SSE2 optimisaiton
    -DBUILD_DOC=OFF|on          build documentation

If you want to have more detailed output when running 'make' you can simply add
'VERBOSE=1' to the make command line.

You can also build packages with cmake:

    Add -DCPACK_BINARY_DEB:BOOL=ON or -DCPACK_BINARY_RPM:BOOL=ON to the
    command line and then "make package". (But this is not extensively tested.)

Please note that running cmake again does NOT reset all options to default or
reconfigure all variables. To restart with a clean configuration delete all files
in your cmake_build folder.

If you prefer setting the configuration with a GUI or want to get an extensive
overview of all available settings and cache values run cmake-gui.

*NB* Certificate Authorities' (CA) certificates have to be available on a system
in order to run `apps/lensfun-update-data` script.

DOCUMENTATION
-------------

The end-user documentation for the library can be built by issuing the
command:

    make docs

Also you can read it online at any time by pointing your browser to:

	https://lensfun.github.io/manual/latest

The documentation on the site is updated every night from Git, so it always
contains the latest info on the library.
