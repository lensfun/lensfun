 * <li>Fix lens distortion
 * <li>Fix lens geometry
 * <li>Scale the image
 * </ol>
 *
 * This is the theoretical order.  But in reality, when using this library, the
 * order is reversed (see \ref corrections for an explanation):
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>Color<ol>
 * <li>Fix lens vignetting
 * </ol>
 * <li>Coordinates<ol>
 * <li>Scale the image
 * <li>Fix lens geometry
 * <li>Fix lens distortion
 * </ol>
 * <li>Subpixel coordinates<ol>
 * <li>Fix chromatic aberrations (TCA)
 * </ol>
 * </ol>
 *
 * This process is divided into three stages.
 *
 * In the first stage, the colors of the image pixels are fixed
 * (vignetting). You pass a pointer to your pixel data, and it will be modified
 * in place.
 *
 * Then, the distortions introduced by the lens are removed (distortion and
 * geometry), and an additional scaling factor is applied if required.  This
 * operation requires building new image in a new allocated buffer: you cannot
 * modify the image in place, or bad things will happen.  Note that Lensfun
 * does not provide pixel interpolation routines.  You have to implement the
 * lookup in the original image yourself.
 *
 * And finally, in the subpixel distortion stage, application corrects
 * transversal chromatic aberrations. For every target pixel coordinate the
 * modifier will return you three new coordinates: the first will tell you the
 * coordinates of the red component, second of the green, and third of the blue
 * component. This again requires copying the image, but you can use the same
 * buffers as in stage two, just in reverse order.
 *
 * Of course, you can skip some stages of the process, e.g. if you, for
 * example, don't want to change a fisheye image to a rectilinear you
 * can omit that step.
 *
 * Obviously, when simulating lens distortions, the modification stages
 * must be applied in reverse order. While the library takes care to reverse
 * the steps which are grouped into a single stage, the application must
 * apply the stages themselves in reverse order.
 *
 * HOWEVER. Doing it in three stages is not memory efficient, and is prone to
 * error accumulation because you have to interpolate pixels twice - once
 * during stage 2 and once during stage 3. To avoid this, it is sensful to do
 * stages 2 & 3 in one step.  In this case the output R,G,B coordinates from
 * stage 2, which treats the colour channels equally, are fed directly into
 * stage 3, which will correct the R,G,B coordinates further.
 * ApplySubpixelGeometryDistortion() does this in a convenient fashion.

     * @param point
     *     The polar coordinates of the point for which the distance of the
     *     corrected counterpart should be calculated.
     * @return
